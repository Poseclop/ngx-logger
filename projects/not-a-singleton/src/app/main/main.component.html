  No monitor is set so we take the monitor that is already set (if any)
  In this example we take the "app monitor" registered from app.module.ts

<div>
  <p>Log level is : {{ logger.level }} </p>
  <p>This should not be changed by the updateConfig of the not-a-singleton route</p>
</div>


<button (click)="log()">Log</button>
