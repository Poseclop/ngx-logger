# Contributing

In progress...

All are welcome to contribute to NGX Logger. A couple quick notes to get started:

- NGX Logger is built with angular-cli
- To use npm link, you must link the /src (or /dist after it is built) directory not root.
- When possible, try to follow patterns that have already been established in the library
- Try to make your code as simple as possible
  - Even if the code could be made shorter, having code that is readable and easily understood is way more valuable
- Have fun!
