# Customising NGXLogger behavior

NGXLogger is fully customisable

Before customising please be mindful of the following

Customising is for :
 - Specific behaviors that contributors do not wish to include in the lib (several reasons could be invoked, too complex, too specific, makes the lib too heavy etc...)
 - Specific behaviors that can't be configured

Customising is not for :
 - Bug fixes
 - Improvements of the NGXLogger

In those cases, please submit a PR or an issue
